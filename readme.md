# Pi-hole + Unbound for Docker

Easy quick start template to use Pi-hole + Unbound on your local Docker install. I did this to learn more about the two before setting them up on my own Ubuntu server.

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

1. Make sure you have Docker installed
2. Clone the directory and change into project directory

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/redoral/pihole-unbound-docker
$ cd pihole-unbound-docker
```

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project, then add your desired web password. This will be used to access the pi-hole web GUI.

```js
# .env
WEB_PASSWORD=REPLACE_WITH_DESIRED_PASSWORD
```

4. Run `docker compose`

```sh
$ docker compose up -d
```

5. Verify you can access the pi-hole web GUI by navigating to `localhost/admin` in your browser.

6. Update DNS servers on your devices to use Pi-hole
